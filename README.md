Overview:
The Work Hours and Salary Calculator is a Python-based program designed to help individuals or businesses accurately calculate total hours worked and the corresponding salary. It supports flexible pay structures, including regular hourly rates and extra pay for specific days.

Features:
Calculate Total Hours: Automatically computes the total hours worked from logged entry and exit times.
Flexible Pay Rates: Supports variable hourly pay rates.
Extra Pay Handling: Accounts for days with additional pay using a customizable multiplier.
Detailed Breakdown: Provides a summary of total hours, base salary, extra pay, and the total combined salary.

Requirements:
Python Version: Python 3.6+
Libraries:
datetime (built-in)

How It Works:
Input Work Logs: Provide a list of entry and exit times for each work session.
Specify Hourly Rate: Input the hourly pay rate.
Add Extra Pay Days (optional): Provide a list of dates that qualify for extra pay.
Set Extra Rate (optional): Define a multiplier for extra pay days (default is 1.5).
The program calculates:
Total hours worked.
Base salary (regular hours).
Extra pay (on special days).
Total salary including extra pay.

Example Usage:
Input Example:
entries = [
    {'entry': '2024-11-01 09:00', 'exit': '2024-11-01 17:00'},
    {'entry': '2024-11-02 09:30', 'exit': '2024-11-02 18:00'},
    {'entry': '2024-11-03 08:45', 'exit': '2024-11-03 16:45'}
]

hourly_rate = 15.0
extra_pay_days = ['2024-11-02']
extra_rate = 1.5

Output Example:
Total hours worked: 24.25 hours
Total salary: $378.75
Total extra pay: $22.50
Total salary including extra pay: $401.25

Future Improvements:
Add CSV file import/export for work logs.
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier input.
Implement overtime calculations for hours exceeding a daily or weekly threshold.
